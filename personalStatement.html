                            <p>My interest in computers and specifically programming has grown a lot over the past few years, especially through my education. I was heavily influenced by my older brother who now pursues a career in the computer industry. With it being his experience in computing that sparked my interest in this field of work, my interest in software and programming developed further in secondary school and has grown through my time at college.</p>
                            <p>From my experiences in education, the workplace and from other experiences in life I am very confident in my team-working ability as well as being independent and knowledgeable enough to work unassisted. After leaving school in fourth year I immediately entered NQ software development which expanded my knowledge to multiple programming languages instead of the one singular language I was used to at school. I progressed through NQ very successfully particularly enjoying units that focused on java and C# until I began my HNC course. HNC was definitely a more challenging year but it gave me insight into how HND and university would be with the graded unit examination which I studied extensively for and subsequently passed. HNC was a very beneficial year at college as I expanded on skills I already knew as well as learning new skills such as implementing databases into a software application. HNC also involved a team working unit which I feel was very beneficial. I am currently studying an HND in Software Development which has certainly been the most challenging but advantageous year I have spent at college with myself constantly improving on my knowledge including the aforementioned skills I learned in HNC. I achieved great results in my exams both during my time at school and college. I believe leaving school in 4th year was a very advantageous decision as it gave me an environment where I could focus solely on computing and software. This was very useful from both an educational and personal viewpoint as it let me add to my knowledge while simultaneously working in a very professional and mature environment, giving me an insight of what university and a future workplace will be like. After achieving my NQ and learning basic programming skills I was led to enrol in online courses including paid and free resources. These extra resources have taught me a range of programming techniques and skills which I have continued to use throughout my time in college. While at college I have also acquired multiple vendor qualifications from major technology companies such as Microsoft and Oracle.</p>
                            <p>My interest in software engineering lies in the comfort that there are many career paths and opportunities meaning I will be able to find the right career no matter what that may be. While I have gained a significant amount of experience and many skills from my time in education and separately I would never shy away from the chance to further increase these skills and even learn new ones. My interest also stems to the broad amount of technologies that are available to us that is ever increasing and to be a part of that increase as a developer is really exciting to me.</p>
                            <p>To really pursue my interest in reaching my career goals as a professional software developer I feel that the next logical step is to attend university and gain a degree in this field, especially at a very reputable institution who I believe can give me the necessary skills and knowledge to hopefully find myself in the employ of a thriving and successful software development company. I look forward to whatever challenges and obstacles that will come my way and the knowledge and understanding I will gain from the experience. Given the opportunity I would apply maximum effort to do well and gain a degree in something that I have a huge interest in pursuing. I believe I have the motivation and dedication required to do this and exceed any expectations placed on me.</p>
